# Hostel Management System

## Background
In the summer of 2018, the student members of the Software Wing of Geekhaven, the technical society of IIIT Allahabad came up with the idea to make a website to automate and simplify everything related to the hostels of our college. We decided to use Django for back-end and simple HTML/CSS for front-end. The aim of the project is to completely automate the process of allotting rooms to students. The students will not have to go through the hassle of reporting at the hostel or fight their way to find out which rooms are vacant at the caretakerâ€™s office anymore. Now they will be able to select a room by logging into the online portal.
